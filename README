Hi, everyone -

We are no longer able to maintain RMagick and are looking for someone or some people to take over maintenance of it. If you're interested or want more details, please let us know!

It is a cool project, written in C and Ruby, with lots of great developers relying on it. The code, originally written by Tim Hunter, is clean and easy-to-understand, and there are a lot of directions you could take it to make it even more useful.

We've had to stop maintaining it due to ever-increasing constraints on our time.

Thanks,
- Benjamin and Omer.
